Want to beat up [shitsec](shitsec)? Cant assassinate your target no matter what? want to learn to play sec better? Well first you'll need to learn to be robust! This may take a while. The Actual Introduction= \u00b6 One thing you need to know about combat in ss13, is that it is often not the best option. In many scenarios you may be better off explaining your actions or surrendering peacefully. If you arent an [antagonist](antagonist), getting into way more fights than needed can place you in the crosshairs of an [admin](admin), with consequences that can last between rounds. If you are entirely new to the game, combat is not the first thing you should learn, rather, you should prioritize learning [very basic skills](How not to die instantly) and the non-combat parts of roles. Without further adieu, Combat in ss13 is one of its most complex and varied systems, with the majority of other systems playing into it in at-least some way. This means that depending on your job and equipment, and that of your opponent, every fight can involve different and varied tactics. This guide will cover movement, preparation, keeping yourself alive, killing the other guy, utilizing and fighting groups and dealing with fallout that may result from combat. Movement= \u00b6 Movement is a very important part of combat, and good movement will allow you to stay alive and kill your opponents much easier. The key to movement in combat is to minimize the amount of moments your in their line of fire, while maximizing the amount you can use your own weapons. If you are good enough, and master movement, you can even dodge bullets. Moving Defensively== \u00b6 If you wish to not end up a corpse, the best way to stay alive is to not be there to get shot. If someone has put in the preparation to kill you and your caught with your pants down, your best option is to run like hell and scream bloody murder, unless, of course, everyone else wants you dead too, in which case your best off not drawing extra attention. If your not wanted by [security](Security Officer), your best option is to run into a high traffic or patrolled area like the main hall or security, and let others deal with the problem for you. If you are, however, you should do the exact opposite. Running into the maintenance shafts and turning off all your lights is preferable. If your opponent is chasing you, but out of sight, open doors while running so as to trick them into going down the wrong hall or into dead ends. if you know the map or come across them, corners and intersections are your best choice to lose your opponent. Corners block line of sight, and lines of fire, while intersections force them to choose between routes. If you know they don't have access to an area, you can run into it and lock the door behind you. Similarly, if you see a locker on your route, you can hide inside it so the person chasing you loses track. If you can stomach it, or have a space suit, the void of space is a very easy way to lose your opponent. All these will give you time to prepare a fight where you have the advantage. Moving Offensively== \u00b6 There is more to chasing someone than running in a straight line. if you see the person your chasing, try to predict which door they will take when running, and lean towards that side of the hall to gain a slight advantage, a lot like running in the inner part of a track. You can use corners to stage ambushes, which can tie up a fight nicely if you've tricked your opponent into thinking your just going to run away. Similarly, you can use lockers to the same effect. just shove your weapon into your hand and bash their head in while they try and find you. If you have a gun, firing it behind you while being chased will give the person chasing you less time to react to the bullets. If however, you are the one chasing, try using faster RoF weapons, to simply out-spray their ability to dodge rounds. If you have a friend, you can have them block the path of a person your chasing or stand still while you run them into a loop. This is always more effective than simply having two people trying to chase someone down. Preparation= \u00b6 If you want to make a fight easy, and have the time, simply prepare beforehand. A fight in which you are prepared will always end up going better than one you just wing. Your preparation can vary wildly depending on your job, the state of the station, and a very long list of other factors, so this section will cover planning and some of the most accessible ways to prepare. Making a Plan== \u00b6 If you wish to fight, its always best to think up a plan beforehand. Try figuring out how to synergize your equipment, stuns, and possible strategies. First, you should know who it is you are trying to fight. If they have a more important objective, they could simply ignore your attempts to get them killed and walk off. [Nuke ops](Nuclear Emergency), for example, may abandon a fight with you to instead fight the person holding the disk, so it could be easier to lure them into an ambush that way to exploit it. A [captain](captain), on the other hand, is mostly concerned with staying alive and will have someone else do their killing for them. If you know who you are fighting, and know how to use your own gear to its maximum effect, while considering their possible responses, fights you get into should be a breeze. Guns, Sticks, Vests== \u00b6 One way to make combat easier is to simply have the bigger gun. If you set aside time to gather armor and weapons, you may be able to simply outgun your opponents or soak up more rounds. To get these, you can ask around or steal them, though the latter may just result in you getting lit up. If you ask for a weapon, be sure you have a good story to tell the person handing it, or are friends with them after doing them a favour sometime earlier. Alternatively, you can always bribe someone to get a gun. Ruins may also have weapons on offer, though these are often guarded by all manner of fiends or require some thought over. Armor is typically much easier to acquire, and if you ask [security](Security Officer) for a vest they may not even ask questions. Asking someone without an abundance for their clothes, however, will often be met with disappointment. If you have a job that allows you to [buy](Cargo Technician), [take](Security Officer), [grow](Botanist), or [craft](Chemist) your own Armour and weapons, you can simply do that instead of being social. Hrrngg, Narcotics...== \u00b6 Oh, would you look at that, seems the chem system doesnt exist in a functional state. This is a placeholder until it is implemented. Changing the environment== \u00b6 Perhaps the most radical way to fight. If you have a lot of high explosives, materials, time, or the [ability to change the stations atmosphere](Atmospherics Technician), you can simply go and do that. A pre-planted bomb always wins in a gunfight. If you dont have these, you can also go into an area where the environment by default is different. sections of the station that are broken, burning, flooded with flammable gas, or arent on the station at all make great ways to kill someone, so long as you can get them there in the first place. There is nothing more satisfying than leading a group of officers into a corner where you've planted a bomb beforehand, and turning them into a fine red mist. Staying Alive= \u00b6 Keeping yourself alive is, obviously, one of the most important parts of winning a fight. Depending on what you have on you and what your opponent has, you have a wide variety of defensive actions you can take. Obviously, anything covered in moving defensively will not be covered here again. Being a coward== \u00b6 One of the best ways to not end up dead in a gunfight is to not be there. If your unprepared, try to talk your opponent out of a fight or run away. simple as that. If you cant talk them out, try bribing them out of it. Much of being cowardly has been covered in the defensive movement section, so look there for further guidence. Actual methods== \u00b6 Lets say your not a coward, what then? Well, you can always use Armour. Armour is the simplest way to reduce damage taken, though you'll rarely have it available to you. A gun is also a good way to defend yourself, and not necessarily by killing the other person. If you shoot behind you or at them, theres a good chance they'll give up the fight and retreat. Getting Armour and weapons is covered in guns, sticks, and vests. The disarm intent is your fallback for when your stuck in a situation where its you, unarmed and naked, vs a sec officer with his baton out. Spam-click, hope for the best, and use his weapons against him. At the moment, the taser and baton are incredibly powerful, and if you pull it out at a distance where its unlikely you'll be disarmed, you can shut down most fights before they even begin with a quick stun and baton bash. Fire extinguishers, other things that wet floors, and banana peels are great at slipping someone chasing you so that you can get away easily or turn the tables on your foes. Ribs grow back== \u00b6 No matter how good you are at fighting, you WILL be hurt at some point. If your not at full health, your at an inherent disadvantage and should get fixed up at your earliest convenience. If you think you'll be getting into fights often, its a good idea to keep a few brute patches (or possibly a medkit) on you so you can heal yourself between combat. If you don't have either of these, just hang around medical waiting to be healed or steal them. If you [already start with medical gear](Medical Doctor), staying alive between fights becomes trivial. Killing the other guy= \u00b6 A lot of the time in combat, you wont be able to or wont want to non-lethally disable your opponent. If your intent was to kill from the start, a stun of any sort followed by a mag-dump is by far the easiest option for getting rid of someone, though there are several other possible options. Guns== \u00b6 Guns, even thousands of years into the future, haven't deviated from the basic point at the other guy and shoot mentality. Even with laser weapons, guns are really the same regardless of which weapon you use, so long as it isn't meant to be nonlethal. Click, or click and hold, on the other guys sprite or the direction they are moving until they fall over. There exists a very large variety of weapons in ss13, from revolvers more fancy than functional to the dreaded SAW machineguns wielded by nuke ops, and all fit different roles. Just know that ranged weapons in ss13 do follow a hierarchy in terms of use in open combat, but assassination and chases are a much more varied playing field. Melee== \u00b6 Melee combat in SS13 is much riskier than using a firearm, but this comes with greater reward. Melee weapons better reward ambushes, movement, and corner abuse. Or you could just use a taser and then beat them to death, but thats no fun. Just remember that at any time, you can be disarmed in a melee fight and have to fight with your fists or grab your weapon back. Melee weapons dont have as much variety as guns, and have a rather strict heirarchy where batons and eswords rule supreme. Groups= \u00b6 Fighting as a cohesive group is very difficult in unitystation, but is also very rewarding, and practically necessary for antagonists such as nuke ops. If your opponent is a group, cohesive or not, there are ways to fight them, though they may be risky. Fighting as a tight group== \u00b6 Fighting in a cohesive group gives the group a MASSIVE advantage over any Rambo, with very few disadvantages. People in the group are less likely to end up dead, as any injuries can be dealt with while others lay down covering fire. The added firepower is also a great bonus, a man with a taser and e-sword may be an extremely deadly threat, but not to 3 guys with their own weapons. If you wish to fight in a cohesive group, good luck, they are very difficult to form from ordinary crew. If you are a security officer or nuke op however, you can be shoved into one by your superiors or start in a group. One thing typically needed for a cohesive group is an involved leader. In secs case, this is typically the HoS, due to his rank. in nuke op squads or militias however, it may be difficult to find a leader, and the group will start to rapidly lose cohesiveness without one. I have personally seen many nuke ops lose simply because their team split apart and drifted from a lack of leadership. Fighting as a spread out group== \u00b6 Fighting while spread out is the typical course for non-emergency period security as well as rebels. In this non-cohesive form, the group your in is more prone to take losses, but [assuming everyone is competent](So close to impossible that it might as well not even exist), is also capable of inflicting far more damage and covering more ground. The fact that each individual in a spread out group needs combat competence is the reason security so often falls to the all consuming entropic force that is the grey tide, because if one link in security doesn't work, thats an unstopped crime, which leads other to more crime, which piles up and piles up until the station is slagged. Spread out groups can form sporadically and with varying degrees of focus. Assistants, as an example can vary widely from the usual random shenanigans, to the razor focused [tunguska revolt](Tunguska). Fighting groups== \u00b6 Fighting groups can take two routes, depending on the form of the group. a rarer third route is available if you have a group yourself, however. Fighting a clumped up together group as a lone person is HARD, simply due tohe fact that there are more people. One of the best things you can do to give yourself an advantage is to simply spread the group out. a grenade or other explosive will force a group to split up somewhat, allowing you to pick off a member or two. If they are in a tight space with limited exits, a grenade can spell death for the entire group, making them incredibly powerful. In tight groups, people may split off momentarily to deal with injured or other small tasks. if you've only got single target weapons, this is a great time to strike. If the person you find is a doctor of the team tending to an injured person, shoot the injured person. this will often lend you a free kill, and make the doctor either have to leave them dead or drag them to cloning, the latter giving you the opportunity to take them down as well. Fighting melee against tight groups is typically suicide, and not recommended. Fighting spread out groups is far, far easier than fighting a tight group. if youre fighting a spread out group, treat every person you fight as someone peeled off from a tight group, and use the same tactics discussed above for dealing with them. in this case, a quick melee attack can be viable, unlike with tight groups. Fighting groups with your own groups can go a few ways. Spread out vs Spread out is a toss up, and typically decided by a few robust players. Tight vs Tight typicaally turns into a bloodbath where nobody wins. Tight vs spread out will nearly always result in the tight group winning. Aftermath= \u00b6 Well, you killed someone, or a lot of people. Turns out, killing people can have repercussions. This section will be about making sure you dont end up like your victims in the aftermath. There are typically three routes you can go down, with varying degrees of legality and possibility for revenge. Taking responsibility== \u00b6 You see that fella you killed? time to unkill him. This is the best way to avoid the wrath of [sec](Security Officer), the guy you killed and any admins, though it isnt a good option for when you [need them dead](Antagonist) for your employers and may be impossible to do depending on how wanted you are already. The best case scenario is dragging them to cloning yourself, second best is leaving them outside medbay, and third best is just dragging them out into the hall and leaving them there for someone else to clone. The null outcome== \u00b6 Simply dont touch the body after your done. This can be taken as a sign of mercy, incompetence, or mocking, depending on the whims of the person you killed. It wont let you avoid the wrath of [sec](Security Officer), and can leave the guy you killed mad, but it can be enough to make admins brush it aside, so long as you had reason to kill them in the first place. Definitely not the best option, but sometimes necessary, especially if your on the run already. FINISH HIM== \u00b6 The least legal option, by far, the one most likely to leave both the guy you killed and any watching admins mad, but one that can leave the least consequences if pulled off correctly. This option, for obvious reasons, is not a good choice for most interactions for non antags (other than say, gibbing a nuke op), but is excellent for anyone looking to cover their tracks and make sure the person they killed doesn't come back to bite them later down the line. Simply take a knife and cut them up, or toss their body into the void of space. Shoving them in an obscure locker may work, but runs the risk of them being found later. Getting Better \u00b6 Even if you read this page a thousand times, without practice your still going to get your ass beat. the best way to learn to fight in game is to simply fight. stage ragecage matches, play [sec](Security), be an [antag](Antagonist), just don't get mad when your tossed in a cell to rot or turned into swiss cheese by gunfire. {{Role Navbox}}","title":"Combat"},{"location":"Combat/#combat","text":"Got beat up by [shitsec](shitsec)?

This may take a while.","title":"Combat"},{"location":"Combat/#the-actual-introduction","text":"One thing you need to know about combat in ss13, is that it is often not the best option. In many scenarios you may be better off explaining your actions or surrendering peacefully. If you arent an [antagonist](antagonist), getting into way more fights than needed can place you in the crosshairs of an [admin](admin), with consequences that can last between rounds. If you are entirely new to the game, combat is not the first thing you should learn, rather, you should prioritize learning [very basic skills](How not to die instantly) and the non-combat parts of roles. Without further adieu, Combat in ss13 is one of its most complex and varied systems, with the majority of other systems playing into it in at-least some way. This means that depending on your job and equipment, and that of your opponent, every fight can involve different and varied tactics. This guide will cover movement, preparation, keeping yourself alive, killing the other guy, utilizing and fighting groups and dealing with fallout that may result from combat.","title":"The Actual Introduction="},{"location":"Combat/#movement","text":"Movement is a very important part of combat, and good movement will allow you to stay alive and kill your opponents much easier. The key to movement in combat is to minimize the amount of moments your in their line of fire, while maximizing the amount you can use your own weapons. If you are good enough, and master movement, you can even dodge bullets.","title":"Movement="},{"location":"Combat/#moving-defensively","text":"If you wish to not end up a corpse, the best way to stay alive is to not be there to get shot. If someone has put in the preparation to kill you and your caught with your pants down, your best option is to run like hell and scream bloody murder, unless, of course, everyone else wants you dead too, in which case your best off not drawing extra attention. If your not wanted by [security](Security Officer), your best option is to run into a high traffic or patrolled area like the main hall or security, and let others deal with the problem for you. If you are, however, you should do the exact opposite. Running into the maintenance shafts and turning off all your lights is preferable. If your opponent is chasing you, but out of sight, open doors while running so as to trick them into going down the wrong hall or into dead ends. if you know the map or come across them, corners and intersections are your best choice to lose your opponent. Corners block line of sight, and lines of fire, while intersections force them to choose between routes. If you know they don't have access to an area, you can run into it and lock the door behind you. Similarly, if you see a locker on your route, you can hide inside it so the person chasing you loses track. If you can stomach it, or have a space suit, the void of space is a very easy way to lose your opponent. All these will give you time to prepare a fight where you have the advantage.","title":"Moving Defensively=="},{"location":"Combat/#moving-offensively","text":"There is more to chasing someone than running in a straight line. if you see the person your chasing, try to predict which door they will take when running, and lean towards that side of the hall to gain a slight advantage, a lot like running in the inner part of a track. You can use corners to stage ambushes, which can tie up a fight nicely if you've tricked your opponent into thinking your just going to run away. Similarly, you can use lockers to the same effect. just shove your weapon into your hand and bash their head in while they try and find you. If you have a gun, firing it behind you while being chased will give the person chasing you less time to react to the bullets. If however, you are the one chasing, try using faster RoF weapons, to simply out-spray their ability to dodge rounds. If you have a friend, you can have them block the path of a person your chasing or stand still while you run them into a loop. This is always more effective than simply having two people trying to chase someone down.","title":"Moving Offensively=="},{"location":"Combat/#preparation","text":"If you want to make a fight easy, and have the time, simply prepare beforehand. A fight in which you are prepared will always end up going better than one you just wing. Your preparation can vary wildly depending on your job, the state of the station, and a very long list of other factors, so this section will cover planning and some of the most accessible ways to prepare.","title":"Preparation="},{"location":"Combat/#making-a-plan","text":"If you wish to fight, its always best to think up a plan beforehand. Try figuring out how to synergize your equipment, stuns, and possible strategies. First, you should know who it is you are trying to fight. If they have a more important objective, they could simply ignore your attempts to get them killed and walk off. [Nuke ops](Nuclear Emergency), for example, may abandon a fight with you to instead fight the person holding the disk, so it could be easier to lure them into an ambush that way to exploit it. A [captain](captain), on the other hand, is mostly concerned with staying alive and will have someone else do their killing for them. If you know who you are fighting, and know how to use your own gear to its maximum effect, while considering their possible responses, fights you get into should be a breeze.","title":"Making a Plan=="},{"location":"Combat/#guns-sticks-vests","text":"One way to make combat easier is to simply have the bigger gun. If you set aside time to gather armor and weapons, you may be able to simply outgun your opponents or soak up more rounds. To get these, you can ask around or steal them, though the latter may just result in you getting lit up. If you ask for a weapon, be sure you have a good story to tell the person handing it, or are friends with them after doing them a favour sometime earlier. Alternatively, you can always bribe someone to get a gun. Ruins may also have weapons on offer, though these are often guarded by all manner of fiends or require some thought over. Armor is typically much easier to acquire, and if you ask [security](Security Officer) for a vest they may not even ask questions. Asking someone without an abundance for their clothes, however, will often be met with disappointment. If you have a job that allows you to [buy](Cargo Technician), [take](Security Officer), [grow](Botanist), or [craft](Chemist) your own Armour and weapons, you can simply do that instead of being social.","title":"Guns, Sticks, Vests=="},{"location":"Combat/#hrrngg-narcotics","text":"Oh, would you look at that, seems the chem system doesnt exist in a functional state. This is a placeholder until it is implemented.","title":"Hrrngg, Narcotics...=="},{"location":"Combat/#changing-the-environment","text":"Perhaps the most radical way to fight. If you have a lot of high explosives, materials, time, or the [ability to change the stations atmosphere](Atmospherics Technician), you can simply go and do that. A pre-planted bomb always wins in a gunfight. If you dont have these, you can also go into an area where the environment by default is different. sections of the station that are broken, burning, flooded with flammable gas, or arent on the station at all make great ways to kill someone, so long as you can get them there in the first place. There is nothing more satisfying than leading a group of officers into a corner where you've planted a bomb beforehand, and turning them into a fine red mist.","title":"Changing the environment=="},{"location":"Combat/#staying-alive","text":"Keeping yourself alive is, obviously, one of the most important parts of winning a fight. Depending on what you have on you and what your opponent has, you have a wide variety of defensive actions you can take. Obviously, anything covered in moving defensively will not be covered here again.","title":"Staying Alive="},{"location":"Combat/#being-a-coward","text":"One of the best ways to not end up dead in a gunfight is to not be there. If your unprepared, try to talk your opponent out of a fight or run away. simple as that. If you cant talk them out, try bribing them out of it. Much of being cowardly has been covered in the defensive movement section, so look there for further guidence.","title":"Being a coward=="},{"location":"Combat/#actual-methods","text":"Lets say your not a coward, what then? Well, you can always use Armour. Armour is the simplest way to reduce damage taken, though you'll rarely have it available to you. A gun is also a good way to defend yourself, and not necessarily by killing the other person. If you shoot behind you or at them, theres a good chance they'll give up the fight and retreat. Getting Armour and weapons is covered in guns, sticks, and vests. The disarm intent is your fallback for when your stuck in a situation where its you, unarmed and naked, vs a sec officer with his baton out. Spam-click, hope for the best, and use his weapons against him. At the moment, the taser and baton are incredibly powerful, and if you pull it out at a distance where its unlikely you'll be disarmed, you can shut down most fights before they even begin with a quick stun and baton bash. Fire extinguishers, other things that wet floors, and banana peels are great at slipping someone chasing you so that you can get away easily or turn the tables on your foes.","title":"Actual methods=="},{"location":"Combat/#ribs-grow-back","text":"No matter how good you are at fighting, you WILL be hurt at some point. If your not at full health, your at an inherent disadvantage and should get fixed up at your earliest convenience. If you think you'll be getting into fights often, its a good idea to keep a few brute patches (or possibly a medkit) on you so you can heal yourself between combat. If you don't have either of these, just hang around medical waiting to be healed or steal them. If you [already start with medical gear](Medical Doctor), staying alive between fights becomes trivial.","title":"Ribs grow back=="},{"location":"Combat/#killing-the-other-guy","text":"A lot of the time in combat, you wont be able to or wont want to non-lethally disable your opponent. If your intent was to kill from the start, a stun of any sort followed by a mag-dump is by far the easiest option for getting rid of someone, though there are several other possible options.","title":"Killing the other guy="},{"location":"Combat/#guns","text":"Guns, even thousands of years into the future, haven't deviated from the basic point at the other guy and shoot mentality. Even with laser weapons, guns are really the same regardless of which weapon you use, so long as it isn't meant to be nonlethal. Click, or click and hold, on the other guys sprite or the direction they are moving until they fall over. There exists a very large variety of weapons in ss13, from revolvers more fancy than functional to the dreaded SAW machineguns wielded by nuke ops, and all fit different roles. Just know that ranged weapons in ss13 do follow a hierarchy in terms of use in open combat, but assassination and chases are a much more varied playing field.","title":"Guns=="},{"location":"Combat/#melee","text":"Melee combat in SS13 is much riskier than using a firearm, but this comes with greater reward. Melee weapons better reward ambushes, movement, and corner abuse. Or you could just use a taser and then beat them to death, but thats no fun. Just remember that at any time, you can be disarmed in a melee fight and have to fight with your fists or grab your weapon back. Melee weapons dont have as much variety as guns, and have a rather strict heirarchy where batons and eswords rule supreme.","title":"Melee=="},{"location":"Combat/#groups","text":"Fighting as a cohesive group is very difficult in unitystation, but is also very rewarding, and practically necessary for antagonists such as nuke ops.

People in the group are less likely to end up dead, as any injuries can be dealt with while others lay down covering fire. The added firepower is also a great bonus, a man with a taser and e-sword may be an extremely deadly threat, but not to 3 guys with their own weapons. If you wish to fight in a cohesive group, good luck, they are very difficult to form from ordinary crew. If you are a security officer or nuke op however, you can be shoved into one by your superiors or start in a group. One thing typically needed for a cohesive group is an involved leader. In secs case, this is typically the HoS, due to his rank. in nuke op squads or militias however, it may be difficult to find a leader, and the group will start to rapidly lose cohesiveness without one.

Access: Kitchen & Butcher , Maintenance. Difficulty: Easy ''. ''Colloquial title: \"Chef\" Note: for the more detailed guide to food preperation, look [Here](Guide to Food and Drink). Overview \u00b6 The Cook is one of the most simple roles on the station: Make food, serve it to customers, and say no to the [Chaplain](Chaplain) when they ask you to give them a knife for \"[ritualistic purposes](Battle royale)\". Its usually recommended for new players to try the game with this role if they are on their own. Dinner's ready \u00b6 Being a Cook is a relatively simple job. You have one duty: make sure the station doesn't starve. You have two ways of doing this: cooking raw steaks in the microwave, or [botany](Botanist) actually knowing how their job works. As for the meat steaks, you can either go to the Butcher's room (in outpoststation it's the room north of the kitchen, just head into the maintenance tunnels above you and the room will be on the other side), or by bugging [Medical](Medical Doctor) for bodies once they've cloned said bodies. As for Botany, food preparation outside of just making steaks doesn't exist yet, so for now you can just ask them to hand you some crops so you can do your job without there being any meat on the station.

Overview= \u00b6 This guide will cover the basic background info of the reactor, how to start it, how to run it, and how to blow it to hell. Many terms relating to the reactor will also be covered, under the assumption that you are almost certainly not a nuclear physicist. Background= \u00b6 Before you even touch the reactor, its best you know how it works Pipes, steam, water, and a shit-ton of radiation== \u00b6 The reactor has several distinct parts, all of which must be properly connected to each-other for the reactor to work. Starting with the simplest, the water reservoir. It holds water. This water is cycled around the reactor through the use of a pump,it heads to the reactor core where it is heated to steam by the fission reactions within and used to drive a turbine, creating power. the water then returns to the reservoir where it cooled, and the process begins again. This whole system has, as of now, only two weak links, the pipes and the reactor core. The other parts of the reactor can be built with steel in the build menu, but the pipes and core are both irreplaceable. How the core works== \u00b6 The core itself is just as complex as the rest of the reactor combined. Inside the core, fuel rods are used in fission reactions to heat up water cycling through the core. These fuel rods cannot start up on their own, and require a starting rod to fire up initially. Control rods are used to reduce or increase the rate of fission reactions to control the core. The cores pressure and temperature are what you need to control to generate power and avoid getting your teeth kicked in by an admin, Though these are not directly controllable and make up a large chain of dependence. The chain of dependence== \u00b6 As previously mentioned, the temperature and pressure of a core are not directly controllable, only indirectly through a long series of dependencies. Starting from the beginning, you have the number of rods. More fuel rods means more heat and neutrons, while more control rods means more control over other values. The second thing you have control over is rod height. When the control rods are deep in the reactor, they lower the amount of fission reactions that occur, and when they are nearly outside it, the amount of reactions increases. This is measured by the K% value (or more accurately a 1+k%), which shows on a horizontal sliding gauge. This K% value changes the amount of neutron flux exponentially, meaning a K% value of 10 causes the flux to grow not ten times faster than a k value of 1, but a hundred times faster. The neutron flux can be seen as a way to measure how active the reactor is. The higher the flux, the more fission reactions occur. This causes the temperature to increase which in turn increases the pressure of the steam around the reactor. The higher the pressure, the faster the steam moves through the turbine, and the more power is generated. If all this has you confused, try reading the chain of dependency backwards. Starting up the reactor= \u00b6 Starting up the reactor is a rather long process, with multiple steps, and can result in you turning into a fine mist if done incorrectly. Rods== \u00b6 Before starting the reactor, you need to gather what you'll need to do so. these are the rods, typically found someplace near the console. There are three types, control rods, whose function is discussed in \"The chain of dependence\", Fuel rods, which drive the fission reactions and are slowly whittled down by them, and starter rods, which provide the initial neutrons for starting up the reactor. These must be placed into the reactor in an appropriate ratio to avoid it fizzling out or exploding horribly. \"Simple\" reactor setup== \u00b6 This is simply the method that I personally use when I'm just looking to generate power. Id recommend experimenting on private servers if you want to try different setups, as admins frown upon unscheduled reactor decommissioning. Start the plasma generator so crew doesn't complain and your lights/consoles are powered. \u00b6 Gather 4 (or 5) control rods, one fuel rod, and one starter rod. \u00b6 Head out the airlock and plug in the control rods. then the fuel rod, then the starter. \u00b6 run back inside to man the reactor console \u00b6 Raise control rods until the k% value is ~ 6 or 7 \u00b6 Keep it there until the neutron flux reaches a point between 10^5 and 10^6. Going higher will make the reactor MUCH more feisty, exponentially so. \u00b6 Set K% to zero using the rods. \u00b6 Lower and raise K% until a stable and relatively high temp is reached \u00b6 Check that pressure is rising, and use the other console to see if power is being generated \u00b6 go outside, remove the starter rod, be sure your wearing rad-proof gear. \u00b6 go back inside, repeat steps 7-9 as needed \u00b6 Continued operation= \u00b6 Now that you've got the reactor running, you are expected to keep it nice, fueled, and stable. Refueling== \u00b6 The step by step setup should be good for most rounds, lasting over an hour, but if you need to refuel the reactor, head out the airlock, take out the old fuel rod, smack in a new one, and repeat the startup process. Its a good idea to startup the plasma generator beforehand so the crew doesn't complain about the lack of power. If your using a multi fuel rod setup, having someone man the console while your replacing rods is generally a good idea. Safety hazards== \u00b6 Having a very slowly exploding nuke in your backyard comes with a lot of dangers, not the least of which is may blow you into tiny smithereens if you fuck up. Therefore, it is always a good idea to be aware of the various safety hazards it poses. The two largest dangers come down to the fact that the reactor is in space, and that it emits a massive amount of radiation. The first is easily counter-able, just grab a hardsuit, engineering hardsuit preferred, tack on an o2 tank, and wear a mask. The second is more difficult. Even a single fuel rod reactor emits a massive amount of radiation, and anyone near it not wearing radiation protective gear will slowly melt from the inside. The tile above the reactor core, as well as those directly next to it, are typically so radioactive that even this wont help you totally, and even in a full engi hardsuit you will rapidly begin turning into goo if you get too close. Meltdown prevention== \u00b6 Preventing a meltdown is very simple, and there are two ways to do it. Number one is to slam the control rods all the way in once the reactor tries to meltdown, which may not be fast enough if you get there too late. The second option is to go outside yourself and manually take out any fuel rods. If you fail at either, you will be turned into a red unclonable mist still alive and just floating in space because explosions dont damage people yet. sabotage prevention== \u00b6 If you want to prevent someone from turning engineering into a crater on purpose, there are a few things you can try. There are two places you need to protect, but still have accessible, these being the reactor and its control console. If you want to prevent sabotage, walling up the reactor and leaving an engineering airlock is typically the best course of action. The console is typically decently protected, but if you feel the need you can replace the windows with reinforced walls or place the console in a more hidden location. \ud834\udd58\ud834\udd65\ud834\udd6e [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLvsmho1lGA I dont want to set the wooorld on fiiiire]\ud834\udd58\ud834\udd65\ud834\udd6e= \u00b6 So, lets say you're a traitor and need all of engineering gone. There are a few ways you can go about detonating the reactor, depending on if you approach the console or the core first. Chernobyl== \u00b6 The Chernobyl method is fucking with the console and moving the control rods as far out as you can and hoping nobody notices, before blitzing the fuck out of engineering so you don't end up dead yourself. This will take a longer time to come to fruition, and is easier to both stop and repair, but is far less difficult to set up than the other method Ghetto Tsar Bomba== \u00b6 If you've got a deathwish, and access to the rods themselves, this method guarantees the biggest boom. to do it, simply take out all the rods in the core, shove in only fuel rods, smack in a starter, and RUN LIKE HELL. This is more difficult to set up but cannot be stopped using the console and guarantee that the reactor explosion is absolutely massive. This will guarantee a shuttle call and will most certainly get you sent to the void if you aren't an antagonist or have a VERY VERY good reason for doing so.","title":"Guide to the nuclear reactor"},{"location":"Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor/#guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor","text":"Note: The reactor is VERY complicated, and you shouldn't touch it unless you are experienced as an [engineer](engineer) or fully intend to fuck it up.","title":"Guide to the nuclear reactor"},{"location":"Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor/#overview","text":"This guide will cover the basic background info of the reactor, how to start it, how to run it, and how to blow it to hell.

Therefore, it is always a good idea to be aware of the various safety hazards it poses. The two largest dangers come down to the fact that the reactor is in space, and that it emits a massive amount of radiation. The first is easily counter-able, just grab a hardsuit, engineering hardsuit preferred, tack on an o2 tank, and wear a mask. The second is more difficult. Even a single fuel rod reactor emits a massive amount of radiation, and anyone near it not wearing radiation protective gear will slowly melt from the inside. The tile above the reactor core, as well as those directly next to it, are typically so radioactive that even this wont help you totally, and even in a full engi hardsuit you will rapidly begin turning into goo if you get too close.","title":"Safety hazards=="},{"location":"Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor/#meltdown-prevention","text":"Preventing a meltdown is very simple, and there are two ways to do it. Number one is to slam the control rods all the way in once the reactor tries to meltdown, which may not be fast enough if you get there too late.

Used for communicating in-roleplay with other people. IC chat's default key is T (Y for IC chat over communications, if you have a comms headset equipped). 'Metagaming [against the rules]' The IC use of information that you gained OOCly, an example being to kill John Doe because someone OOCly is complaining to an admin about how John RDMed. Another, less frequently used form of metagaming is Metagrudging, in which you attack or otherwise interact with someone based on something that happened in a previous round of Unitystation. 'Icky Ocky [against the rules]' Means IC in OOC. A common example is telling people to clone you and revealing where your body is. Often times giving instructions on how a machine or item works in OOC chat is NOT icky ocky. 'Antag' Means [Antagonist](Antagonist). Used when you're too lazy to just say antagonist. 'Gray/Greytide' When hordes of new players flood servers of Unitystation or SS13. Name comes from the fact that most new players pick [Assistant](Assistant), who wear gray jumpsuits. One form of graytide is Tubertide, where new players flood the game because of a popular or semi-popular youtuber making a video on or mentioning the game.

Used for discussions outside of the game (for example letting people know how ridiculous your death was). OOC chat's default key is U. 'IC' Abbreviation for In Character. Used for communicating in-roleplay with other people. IC chat's default key is T (Y for IC chat over communications, if you have a comms headset equipped). 'Metagaming [against the rules]' The IC use of information that you gained OOCly, an example being to kill John Doe because someone OOCly is complaining to an admin about how John RDMed. Another, less frequently used form of metagaming is Metagrudging, in which you attack or otherwise interact with someone based on something that happened in a previous round of Unitystation. 'Icky Ocky [against the rules]' Means IC in OOC. A common example is telling people to clone you and revealing where your body is. Often times giving instructions on how a machine or item works in OOC chat is NOT icky ocky. 'Antag' Means [Antagonist](Antagonist). Used when you're too lazy to just say antagonist. 'Gray/Greytide' When hordes of new players flood servers of Unitystation or SS13. Name comes from the fact that most new players pick [Assistant](Assistant), who wear gray jumpsuits. One form of graytide is Tubertide, where new players flood the game because of a popular or semi-popular youtuber making a video on or mentioning the game.

It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security. For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence. In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe. A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on. Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the same crime as the person you aided. {{Sub Header|text=Brig Procedures}} 'Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows:' Take the prisoner to the brig and inform the Warden of their crimes so their Security Record may be updated. \u00b6 Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer. \u00b6 Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker and hold the prisoner over it. \u00b6 Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc. \u00b6 Buckle the prisoner to the bed. \u00b6 Search the items removed and be sure to check the internals box in their backpack. \u00b6 Confiscate any contraband and/or stolen items, as well as any tools that may be used for future crimes. These are to be placed in evidence, 'not left on the brig floor or your personal use', until they can be returned to their rightful owners. \u00b6 Close the locker and 'lock it'. \u00b6 Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell. \u00b6 Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable. \u00b6 'Do ''NOT '' fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence.' In the event of a sentence exceeding the 10 minute limit of the timer inform the Warden so he may add the rest of the time later. In the instance of prisoners that have earned [[Labor Camp]] duty, you must dress them in orange overalls and assign them targets, based on their sentence, by getting a prison ID, putting it in a [[Prisoner Management Console]], assigning their quota (with a conversion rate of 100 points per minute otherwise served in the brig) and then giving them the ID as you ship them to the Labor Camp. There are more details on this procedure at [[Labor Camp]].** NOTE: In the current revision of TG, Mineral spawn is heavily reduced in the gulag area. If you plan on using the gulag for several incidences [meaning the floors are already mined so people can't mine the floors for glass], you should use a lower conversion rate. The [Warden](Warden) or [[Head of Security]] are responsible for placing prisoners and in permanent confinement. Permanent Prisoners are to be completely stripped of their belongings, which are to be held in either evidence or a prison locker. \u00b6 The prisoner is to be dressed in an Orange Prison Jumpsuit and Shoes, which are found in the prison lockers. \u00b6 Permanent Prisoners are not permitted to possess any personal belongings whilst they are incarcerated in the [[Prison Wing]]. \u00b6 The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners. Simply do not issue a prisoner ID when transferring them to the camp. \u00b6 {{Sub Header|text=Legal Representation and Trials}} Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation however you are under no obligation to provide or allow this. Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked. If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it. In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the [chain of command](Chain_of_Command) 'must' be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective. Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence. Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence. In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial 'is required' to authorise the death penalty. {{Sub Header|text=Use of Deadly Force}} As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology. It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation. There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible: 'Code Red Situation' - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level. 'Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective' - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile. 'Severe Personal Risk' - sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings. Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions. 'Armed and Dangerous' - if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets. *'Multiple Hostiles - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. **As a last resort' if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground. Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target. Minor Crimes \u00b6 All of these crimes carry a 1 minute sentence. {| style## \"text-align:center; background-color:#ffee99;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing\"0\" ! style## \"background-color:#ffee55;\" width\"20px\" |Code ! style## \"background-color:#ffee55;\" width\"1px\" | ! style## \"background-color:#ffee55;\" width\"130px\" |Crime ! style## \"background-color:#ffee55;\" width\"300px\" |Description ! style## \"background-color:#ffee55;\" width\"300px\" |Notes |- |101 |[[File:Resisting Arrest.PNG|link=Special:FilePath/Resisting_Arrest.PNG]] |'Resisting Arrest' |To not cooperate with an officer who attempts a proper arrest. | Follow proper arrest procedure and have a legitimate cause to arrest in the first place before you brig a suspect for this.

It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security. For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence. In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe. A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on.

Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked. If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it. In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the [chain of command](Chain_of_Command) 'must' be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective. Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence. Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence. In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial 'is required' to authorise the death penalty. {{Sub Header|text=Use of Deadly Force}} As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology. It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation. There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible: 'Code Red Situation' - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level. 'Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective' - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile. 'Severe Personal Risk' - sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings. Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions. 'Armed and Dangerous' - if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets. *'Multiple Hostiles - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. **As a last resort' if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground. Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target.","title":"The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners.

Oh wait, it is watching grass grow \u00b6 Despite Botanist being classed as Medium, it's currently one of the easiest roles.

At the moment, the amount of things the botanist can do is limited. Grow apples to supplement the hunger for meat and grow wheat so the [Cook](Cook) can blend it into flour for burgers. When civil station life [disintegrates](Battle royale), grow bananas and lay a minefield of peels around your turf to dissuade attackers. If you're an [Antagonist](Antagonist), you should mass produce as many lemons as you can, destroying the plants after each harvest and planting new ones from your yield or simply using unstable mutagen with a non-help intent to get mass producible grenades.

Access : Everything . Difficulty : Extreme . Colloquial name: \"Cap\" Overview \u00b6 Captain is the hardest role on the station. At first glance, your job might seem simple. Just make sure every department is doing what they're supposed to do and hitting the quotas set by [Centcom](Central Command Officer), and make sure that no [Antagonists](Antagonist) can sabotage the place. However, it's never that simple. Not only is your job to prevent the station from descending into chaos, it's also your job to plan the next course of action once prevention fails. Of course, calling the Emergency Shuttle is an option, but that should only be done when all other options have been exhausted. That's not the only thing making your job difficult either; [everyone](Traitor) that has [some](Nuke Ops) form of [sabotage](Cargonia) in mind will have a crosshair aimed straight at your head, so be careful when Jimmy Bob asks you to follow him into the maintenance tunnels. It is your duty to ensure the stability and productivity of the station as well as the safety of your crew. You should have experience in all of the Heads of Staff jobs and reasonable combat skills. It is suggested that you only pick Captain if you think you're robust enough to handle the challenges. So, how do you stay alive? \u00b6 With so many people out for your life, you'd be glad to know that your office comes with your own special gun, called the Imperator, as well as a security belt and taser. You also start with the best general purpose armor on the station (though it only protects your chest) and a wickedly durable hardsuit in your office (which protects your whole body while wearing it with the helmet, but it slows you down a bunch). All of these things are good for shooting someone with and running away. That's right, running away. Unless you are very, very, robust, your best option when [guys in red hardsuits](Nuke Ops) or some [greyshirt](Assistant) with a sketchkin attacks you is to run the hell away. That, or hiding in the armory behind walls of [meatshields](Security Officer). Delegator Prime \u00b6 When you are not fighting off [nukies](Nuke Ops) and evading [traitorous](Traitor) [assistants](Assistant), you are monitoring, managing, and inspecting. You have the ultimate veto power over all matters. There really is no way to tell you exactly how to run things, but here's some things you should keep in mind: 'Do not get involved, Delegate everything.' You should avoid doing any tasks that can be done by a subordinate. If there's a hull breach, do not fix it yourself. Get your [CE](Chief Engineer) to get off his ass and do it. 'Observe the Chain of Command.' You should spend the majority of the time commanding the department heads. Let them command their departments. Avoid skipping them in the decision-making process as they are the ones who should know their departments best. *'Do not tolerate excessive incompetence.' If a department head repeatedly demonstrates ineptitude at their job, or direspects your authority, demote them from their position. If they don't comply, have them thrown in the brig and tried for mutiny. Keeping the crew overall happy \u00b6 Delegating and staying hidden can, however, trip you over more than it may help you in many situations, especially if your ordering executions and sec crackdowns often. To help with this, you can try to shed some anonymity through announcements declaring certain things legal and making areas public access. If you legalize drugs and open the gateway to prospecting adventurers, the crew will see you in a more positive light than if you commandeered your personal gestapo to kill any who opposed you. [Secure Dat Fukken Disk](Nuclear Authentication Disk) \u00b6 The first thing you should do is get the fukken nuke disk and hide it on your person. Also take your spare ID. And probably your disk pinpointer, too. Guard the disk with you life. Do not show it to anyone. Do not trust it to anybody except maybe the [[Head of Security]] or [Head of Personnel](HoP). If there is the barest hint of [Syndicate activity](Nuke Ops) on the station, drop whatever you are doing and book it to [Security](Security). The Syndies have their own disk pinpointers, and they can track the disk wherever it is. So if they are attacking the station, you need to squad up with [the boys](Security Officer) ASAP. Abandoning Ship \u00b6 As the way shifts in this game tend to go, at some point it might become necessary to abandon ship. This is done by going to your command console and summoning the Emergency Shuttle. The shuttle will arrive in a shorter amount of time the higher the station alert level is, so if the station is disintegrating from multiple meteor impacts or is actively being attacked, make sure to bump that alert level all the way to red. Don't forget though: You are ultimately responsible for the station. You should not be summoning the shuttle lightly. You should be doing your utmost to keep the station up and running. If the station has sustained damage, appraise its integrity to see if it's repairable first. {{Role Navbox}}","title":"Captain"},{"location":"roles/Captain/#captain","text":"Role type : Command .

Boring Old Safety Crap \u00b6 The thing about dealing with such dangerous substances is that they tend to be able to kill you in an instant as well. To prevent this, read any warnings for the chem your mixing, and be sure to properly separate or stabilize explosives. I myself have been impromptu cremated by a plasma fire and blown to bits by explosions for not paying attention to what i was mixing, much to the horror of the rest of medbay. When in doubt as to whether something could kill you, remember the times in high school sciences classes you had to take tests on lab safety. Chemistry Basics \u00b6 You start with several items on you that are crucial to your success as a chemist. your goggles act just like that of the barkeep, and inform you of the reagents in any beaker you look at and the beakers strewn about your office are very much needed for holding liquids. to start, put one in a chem dispenser. The chem dispenser menu is where you'll spend most of your time as a chemist. The top bar controls how much of a substance you add when pressing a button, while the bottom bar allows you to remove chemicals from the beaker overall. Try mixing any old basic medical chem. The machine next to the dispenser is used for splitting up what you've created and deleting specific amounts of specific reagents. You can choose to get your chem out in the form of a bottle, patch, or pill, with some chems being best applied in certain methods. Experiment with meds and try to create a combination medicine that heals all damage types at once, the CMO will love you. Yeah, cool, when do i learn how to kill things? \u00b6 Much of the damage chemistry can cause comes in two forms, poisons, applied by whatever means you want, and explosives. Poisons can be manufactured in just the same way as medicines and applied in the same manner. Injecting someone you dislike with cyanide will work as a delivery mechanism, be it melee or from the barrel of a dart gun. Grenades are much less focused, but can be incredibly devastating, a good hellnade can render entire departments unusable for the entire round! You must be much more careful with explosives however, as to not blow yourself into tiny chunks. Advanced Chem \u00b6 Chemistry is easy to learn and hard to master. you can make a simple grenade with just water and potassium, but it wont come close to the maxcap breaking nitroglycerin grenades made by a charismatic and skilled chemist. To improve with chemistry, you should start with simple recepies, such as space lube and various medicines and simple toxins, and try your hand at intermediate ones like advanced medicines and basic narcotics. once you've got the hand of those, move on to explosives, poisons, and more advanced chems like meth. Once you feel like you have mastered making one trick ponies, you should move on to combining several medicines, poisons, or explosives to achieve greater effect, until you figure out how to unleash the fires of hell upon the station. {{Role Navbox}}","title":"Chemist"},{"location":"roles/Chemist/#chemist","text":"Role type: Medical .

The chem dispenser menu is where you'll spend most of your time as a chemist. The top bar controls how much of a substance you add when pressing a button, while the bottom bar allows you to remove chemicals from the beaker overall. Try mixing any old basic medical chem. The machine next to the dispenser is used for splitting up what you've created and deleting specific amounts of specific reagents.

The magboots act as any other magboots, and allow you to better engage in combat in areas where the atmosphere is shifting due to breaches or opened canisters. Nuke it from orbit \u00b6 Turns out that the best way to kill something is a large nuclear warhead. While you are not provided one, the station thankfully has one onboard. Your primary goal is to grab the disk, shove it in this nuke, and detonate it with the code provided to you by your overseers. Here's a handy braindead guide to success at deathsquad: Walk towards the nuke disk using your disk tracker if you see something that is alive while walking to the disk, shoot it dead. grab the disk, you may have to kill [whoever](Captain) is holding it walk to the station's onboard nuke. Shove in the disk input the nuke code disable safety and start the timer get as far away from it as you can Death Row \u00b6 So, Centcom's sent a station alert saying in no exhaustive terms how much of a disappointment you have been, and that they've just decided to wipe the slate clean. You're much more the problem then the victim, and they just feel it'd be easier to replace than recover. A Death Squad is on its way right now. What should you do? Well first, you should appraise what tools are available to you, namely; can you get a taser or not? If you have access to security, get a taser as fast as you can. It's the only way you'll stand a chance in a direct confrontation. Other crewmembers will know this, too, so they will go extremely fast. you should also procure other weapons, especially energy weapons to exploit the deathsquad's particular weakness to that type of damage. Also grab a welder if you can easily access one. Try and find people to ally with, one or two people watching your back infinitely increases your survival chances. Whether you can get these things or not, you must evacuate the station through any available means. Without some really strong [leadership](Captain), the station is likely already devolving into a complete [free-for-all](Battle royale), so crew are going to be stealing any docked shuttles fast. Try and get one for yourself. Most station maps give one to [mining](Shaft Miner), [engineering](Engineer), and some give one to command. The other more risky choice is the emergency shuttle, It's very likely to become more of a trap than a viable method of escape. Deathsquad will quickly be swarming all over evac, shooting anyone that tries to get on board. If they aren't, then you should find a room to hide in nearby evac. For even further security, take your blowtorch and weld doors shut to slow hunting death squad down. They can destroy doors in half a dozen shots from their disruptor cannons, but that can give ample time to escape and find another hiding place. Also keep in mind that currently deathsquad's night vision does not work, so take out the lights if you can. So, if all shuttles are taken and the emergency shuttle is destroyed or on its way, then you pretty much have one choice left; you've got to take the fight to them. To be honest, without a taser or other ranged stunning weapons, this is all but impossible. explosives deal no damage to death squad, and all it takes is for them to snap off a handful of shots and you will be dead from full health. So, play super Viet Cong guerilla-fighter style. Pop off one or two shots at them then flee like mad. rinse and repeat. Wear them down, and do NOT let them get access to healing supplies. Make them over-pursue and bleed out from their wounds. Use banana peels and space lube to slip them up as well. Maybe even steal their weapons while they are slipped on the ground. Set up traps along the way to the station nuke room or the nuke disk if they haven't taken it from the captain's stiff and cold hands. Do not forget that setting off the nuke is their goal, and if they succeed, then it's game over for everyone. Now, understand that even if you do prepare a hell of a defense, getting everything you could want from the armory and a team together to counter attack, or if you just hide in lockers in maintenance the whole time until you can make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle, you should know that there's an extremely high chance of dying. Often it will feel unfair, but that's deathsquad for you. They are meant to cap off the peak crazyness that can happen on unity station. So do what you can to survive, but make sure to have fun with it. And if by some chance you do survive, that's quite an achievement, so feel proud of yourself. {{Role Navbox}}","title":"Death Squad"},{"location":"roles/Death-Squad/#death-squad","text":"Role type : CentCom .

You're much more the problem then the victim, and they just feel it'd be easier to replace than recover. A Death Squad is on its way right now. What should you do? Well first, you should appraise what tools are available to you, namely; can you get a taser or not? If you have access to security, get a taser as fast as you can. It's the only way you'll stand a chance in a direct confrontation. Other crewmembers will know this, too, so they will go extremely fast. you should also procure other weapons, especially energy weapons to exploit the deathsquad's particular weakness to that type of damage. Also grab a welder if you can easily access one. Try and find people to ally with, one or two people watching your back infinitely increases your survival chances. Whether you can get these things or not, you must evacuate the station through any available means. Without some really strong [leadership](Captain), the station is likely already devolving into a complete [free-for-all](Battle royale), so crew are going to be stealing any docked shuttles fast. Try and get one for yourself. Most station maps give one to [mining](Shaft Miner), [engineering](Engineer), and some give one to command. The other more risky choice is the emergency shuttle, It's very likely to become more of a trap than a viable method of escape. Deathsquad will quickly be swarming all over evac, shooting anyone that tries to get on board. If they aren't, then you should find a room to hide in nearby evac. For even further security, take your blowtorch and weld doors shut to slow hunting death squad down. They can destroy doors in half a dozen shots from their disruptor cannons, but that can give ample time to escape and find another hiding place. Also keep in mind that currently deathsquad's night vision does not work, so take out the lights if you can. So, if all shuttles are taken and the emergency shuttle is destroyed or on its way, then you pretty much have one choice left; you've got to take the fight to them. To be honest, without a taser or other ranged stunning weapons, this is all but impossible. explosives deal no damage to death squad, and all it takes is for them to snap off a handful of shots and you will be dead from full health. So, play super Viet Cong guerilla-fighter style. Pop off one or two shots at them then flee like mad. rinse and repeat. Wear them down, and do NOT let them get access to healing supplies. Make them over-pursue and bleed out from their wounds. Use banana peels and space lube to slip them up as well. Maybe even steal their weapons while they are slipped on the ground. Set up traps along the way to the station nuke room or the nuke disk if they haven't taken it from the captain's stiff and cold hands. Do not forget that setting off the nuke is their goal, and if they succeed, then it's game over for everyone. Now, understand that even if you do prepare a hell of a defense, getting everything you could want from the armory and a team together to counter attack, or if you just hide in lockers in maintenance the whole time until you can make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle, you should know that there's an extremely high chance of dying. Often it will feel unfair, but that's deathsquad for you. They are meant to cap off the peak crazyness that can happen on unity station. So do what you can to survive, but make sure to have fun with it. And if by some chance you do survive, that's quite an achievement, so feel proud of yourself. {{Role Navbox}}","title":"Death Row"},{"location":"roles/Detective/","text":"Detective \u00b6 Role type: Security .

ERT Overall \u00b6 So, the station is fucked, but not fucked enough to warrant a [deathsquad](Death Squad)? Is [someone](Captain) in command simply incompetent? Has someone killed a [centcom officer](Central Command Officer)? Well, its times like these that an ERT team may be sent, especially if one is requested using the communications console. The ERT officers are well armed and can adapt to fill a wide variety of roles, from fixing a reactor about to blow to spreading the word of the honk-mother. Know Your Power Rangers \u00b6 ERT come in the following types. Commanders, who lead ERT teams, Security, who act as guards, Medical, who act as doctors, Engineers, who act more like emergency repairmen, and a variety of joke roles. All ERT officers are armed with an energy carbine (or tactical variant) and a stun baton and all of them are equipped with heavily armored ERT hardsuits. You should expect any ERT squad members to be at least competent in their assigned role. Leading the A-team, ERT commanders \u00b6 ERT commanders are the most barebones squad member, equipped with nothing but their carbine, 2 batons, and a set of handcuffs. Their job, as the name implies, is to lead the ERT team on whatever objective they are given by [centcom](Admin). To do this, they can make use of the unique centcom channel to communicate plans, information, and orders to other members of the ERT team. If the CoC is broken or [the station is in anarchy](Battle royale), the commander ERT may be forced to TEMPORARILY take charge in order to plug the power vacuum and allow a proper leader to be found peacefully. Diet Deathsquad, ERT Security \u00b6 The ERT security officer acts as the spearpoint of any ERT team. They are armed with a tactical energy carbine, baton, taser, and two pairs of handcuffs, and sport a red and black hardsuit. They are typically sent to to apprehend [security](Security Officer) or [heads](HoP) [of](Chief Engineer) [staff](Captain) when the personnel onboard the station are unable or unwilling to do so. This typically is not a peacful affair, and security ERT tend to kill more often then they apprehend, which is why they are often confused as being a [deathsquad](Death Squad). Glorified medkits, ERT Doctors \u00b6 Although they are occasionally deployed to handle large scale medical emergencies, ERT medics often serve not to save the crew, but to heal the ERT squad should they face especially heavy resistance. They wear a white marked hardsuit and are equipped with first aid kit and a life saver belt. They will typically follow behind any ERT security so as to respond faster to any injuries they may suffer. The Only Competent Engineers, ERT Engineers \u00b6 ERT engineers are only typically sent when something onboard the station has, or is about to, blow up horribly. Their job is to fix the damage to the station or prevent further damage, and in this they act more like emergency repairmen than engineers. They are the type of ERT that will most often split from the squad, simply because while the other ERT are sent to deal with people, the engineer is sent to deal with walls and reactors, both of which tend not to have legs. Along with the usual gun and baton, they come with a tool belt, industrial welding tool, and a first aid kit. Joke ERT \u00b6 There are also three types of joke ERT: Janitor ERT, sent to purify and cleanse the station of filth and grime.

Access: Engineering , Maintenance. Difficulty: Medium Overview \u00b6 Engineers are the repairmen and electricians of the station. If there's a hole in the station providing one of the hallways or departments with a fresh view of space, it's the Engineer's job to fix it. If wires have been cut and half the station is out of power, it's the Engineer's job to fix it. As an Engineer, people expect you to know at least the basics of Construction, how the power system works and how to lay wires, etc. If you're ever confused on what to do, ask the [[Chief Engineer]]. They should give you advice, since they are your superior and it's their job to coordinate and assist engineers. At the bare minimum, you must know how to fix a hull breach and how to turn on the plasma generator. Learn how to do these as an asssistant to the [CE](Chief Engineer) before you play as the only engineer on a low population server. Otherwise, you will have a really angry station on your back. Bob the Builder \u00b6 this is just a very basic guide to how the construction system works. for a more in-depth guide, see [Construction](Construction) In Unitystation, there are three materials you'll need to worry about: Metal Plates, Glass Sheets, and Metal Rods. There are some more, but these are the ones you'll most often be using. In order to craft/construct something, have a material selected in your hand, and either press Z or click on it in your hand. This will open a construction menu where you can select what item to build. Keep in mind some items will need more materials than others, for example a department battery will need 30 metal plates where as a girder will only need 2. Once you've clicked on the item you want to build, wait for the bar above your head to fill up, and boom, you've built the item you want to build. Another note is that some items in the construction menu are intermediary constructions that must be finished with additional construction. For example, to build a wall requires you to construct a metal girder with 2 metal sheets, then finish the wall by clicking on the girder with 2 more sheets. Construction materials will go very fast, especially with a full engineering department. It will likely be necessary to order more materials from [Cargo](Quartermaster). If you have a [CE](Chief Engineer), get in touch with them about what you need. Their status as a head will get things ordered and shipped faster. However, some [Shaft Miners](Shaft Miner) [might](So close to impossible that it might as well not even exist) randomly show up with a humongous shipment of construction materials, both basic and exotic, to let you go nuts with. Be thankful you don't have to share them with [Science](Roboticist) yet. Electricity \u00b6 An Engineer's job is also to keep the station powered. Often times, this is relatively simple: Keep the Plasma Generator stocked up on Plasma. On most stations, a crate of plasma will be available to you at round start, but the rest of engineering's stockpile is usually kept locked by shutters, unlockable only by the Chief Engineer. If someone complains about the lack of power despite the generator being fine, head to the area without power and make sure the wiring hasn't been cut. The alternative to powering the station is the nuclear reactor. 'Do not fuck with the reactor until you have fully read [the guide to starting the reactor](Guide to the nuclear reactor) or it will fuck you back faster than you can even imagine.' Tools \u00b6 Engineers get given a set of tools, both in their toolbelt and in toolboxes stored around the department. These include: A Crowbar, for prying up floor tiles and prying open stuck doors and firelocks A Screwdriver, for detaching windows, grilles, and dismantling unsecured girders A Welder, for detaching the plates from walls A Wrench, for securing and unsecuring items (such as vents, girders, plasma tanks [when in a shuttle's fuel slot], etc.) A Wirecutter, for cutting wires and destroying grilles A Multitool, used for a variety of niche purposes.

Access: Medbay , Cloning , Morgue , Surgery ,Maintenance. Difficulty: Medium . Overview \u00b6 Medics are arguably the most vital role to a thriving station, except for [Security](Security) and [Command](Captain). Their job is to heal any injured people, clone dead crew members, and provide the kitchen with dead bodies when other food sources run out. While it's not a required part of the role, it should be noted that non-[antagonist](antagonist) Medical Officers are generally expected to do no harm unless your own life or the life of an innocent is at stake; Your purpose is to preserve human life above all else. This doesn't mean you can't make people harm themselves or make other people do the harm for you, but it means that your most efficient tool to fight is running away. Screaming is a close second. Don't worry, ribs grow back! \u00b6 Playing a Medical Doctor is a hell of a job. 80% of the time nothing is happening. You're just pacing back and forth, filling out inane paperwork, slapping bandaids on assistants who electrocuted themselves trying to open doors they aren't supposed to be accessing, just waiting for shit to happen. The remaining 20% of the job is the most desperate struggle to ward off the oncoming, unstoppable advances of death incarnate.'' All is quiet until suddenly, [something](Events) happens and half the station is dead or dying. Bodies begin piling up at the front door, some crying in pain, others very ''very dead. No one can tell you how any of these people died or got hurt, they just found them. You buckle down and begin treatment as fast as you can, rapidly blazing through bruise packs and ointment. Some are rescued but others are getting worse and worse. You begin having to make decisions on who lives and who dies as the numbers needing CPR triple those that can give it. It's all very rewarding and dramatic, until you realize that you can just let everyone die and clone them instantly, saving oodles of time, resources, and effort. Derp. Whispers no they don't \u00b6 Well, besides all that, let's get into the art of treatment and diagnosis. So the first thing you need to know is that all characters have 100 health, but health can go negative down to -100. While a character is above 0 health, they are conscious and functioning. Once they go below 0, they are in critical condition, only able to crawl around very slowly and talk quietly. While in critical condition they also begin to suffocate, taking -1 health from oxygen loss per second. At -25 health, they cannot move or speak any more. at -100 they are dead. So how do you heal hurt people? Well, Medics have access to first aid kits and burn treatment kits, which come with everything you need to treat 95% of injuries encountered (at the moment. Surgery 1.0 will change this when it comes out). The first must-have-at-all-times is the health scanner. It's a tool that when used on a patient, tells you all accumulated damage broken down by type and by body part, allowing you to assess how to proceed with treatment. 'Brute' damage is the most commonly seen type. It is from physical trauma, such as bullets to the chest and toolboxes to the head, as well as damage from low or high pressure environments, such as the vacuum of space. Brute damage is treated with bruise packs. These are found in first aid kits, the medical vending machine, as well as medical life-saver belts. You will typically run through quite a few of these, so refills will probably be necessary from time to time. Bruise packs heal 40 brute damage per use, but only will heal damage on the body part treated, so you will typically waste a lot of the healing potential of each pack as wounds tend to be scattered across the body rather than localized in one spot. The second main source of damage is 'Burn' damage. This is mostly caused from fires and energy weapons, such as energy carbines and light sabres. It shows up, but not as frequently as brute damage. Burn damage is treated with ointment. Typically, you will find that first aid kits are over-provisioned with burn ointment, and you should replace a stack with bruise packs. Burn treatment kits are also a thing, but they are mega overkill for most situations except mass-casualty incidents like station-wide plasma fires. Each ointment use heals 40 burn damage. The third most common damage type is 'oxygen loss (called OxyLoss'), which is more of a symptom of other damage than it is its own damage type. Oxygen damage is accumulated when a character is deprived of oxygen (from space or through station [atmosphere tampering](Atmospherics Technician)) or when they are in critical condition (0 health or less). It behaves exactly like any other damage, but accumulates at a rate of 1 per second. While a person is above 0 health, you can treat OxyLoss just by making sure they apply their internals or bringing them to an oxygenated environment (a place with at least 20% oxygen). Once a patient is in critical condition, however, they lose the ability to breath on their own, so you must apply CPR. CPR is done by clicking on the patient with an empty hand on help intent while they are adjacent to you. CPR takes 5 seconds to be performed, and while you are doing it, the patient stops taking OxyLoss. Once you have completed a round of CPR, the patient's oxygen damage is healed by 2. This means that in order to bring someone out of critical, you may have to perform CPR a lot to get the job done. Another important note is that CPR will not treat the victim's other injuries, so if a patient is at -30 damage from brute and burn sources alone, no amount of CPR will stabilize them until their wounds are treated. This is where help from other medical personnel or even passers-by can be indespensible. Having someone else performing CPR while you diagnose and treat will greatly increase the odds of survival for the patient, especially if there are multiple patients in critical condition. The last damage type currently in game is toxin damage which is only accumulated from radiation poisoning. (This shit is brand new and doesn't quite work how it used to, so idk how to treat it. The charcoal pills don't seem to have an effect, so good luck. If they die, just clone them.) Imitation Meat \u00b6 So let's say you've applied what you know as a professional medical practitioner and your patient still died. Or maybe someone just found a cold stiffy shoved in a locker in maintenance. What do you do then? Well, you clone them, of course. Cloning is the ultimate mulligan. It can be done over and over as long as you've got a body to clone. When a character dies, take them to the cloning room and put them in the DNA scanner. This can be done by click-and-dragging their body into the DNA scanner while they are adjacent to it. once they are in and the scanner is shut, go to the cloning console and hit the scan button to create a DNA record. Once you've got their record, navigate to it and hit clone. If the player has not left the server, then it will start cloning their body. Cloning is really fast, only taking 10~15 seconds. Once they are cloned, make sure to pull their old body out of the scanner so they can re-equip their old gear. When it comes to the intersection between cloning and role-playing; it is generally assumed that a clone does not know how exactly they died or, if they were murdered, who did it. Their memory will be foggy and unclear, and they may have some confusion when it comes to understanding that they are a clone. Treat them with a polite sensitivity and ask them how they feel. Note that the one critical flaw of the cloning process is that it requires a corpse in the first place; one that has not been too chewed up, as well. If the body is lost in space, gibbed by explosions, butchered by the [chef](Cook), or taken extensive enough fire damage as to be turned into a husk, then they cannot be cloned. One preventative measure that can be taken against this outcome is to scan high-risk people (or really any takers) in the DNA scanner in advance. It's also a good idea at round start to take turns with the rest of the medical staff scanning each other just in case something happens. You might think you are perfectly safe being stationed in the department that has the cloner, but you'd be surprised what could happen. Medical Modus Operandi \u00b6 Not sure what to do? Here's a handy set of operations that you can follow: 1) Heal critically injured crew members that are around medbay. They are the top priority. Dead people waiting to be cloned can wait a little longer. There is no heavy risk in doing this activity since people often have other priorities over killing you when they haven't died yet. 2) Clone dead people that were brought to you by another crew member. NEVER go find bodies on your own, as you might accidentally end up reviving a filthy [antagonist](antagonist) that puts you into a box and throws you out an airlock. It also might not be a bad idea to ask [Security](Security) if any dead to-be-clones that you get have any outstanding criminal charges. 3) Do in-the-field medical attention. Sometimes you need to go to the action to save your plasma burned crew mates, it's recommended to bring additional medical supplies so you can dole them out to other responders if the situation's bad enough. 4) Heal random dudes. When someone arrives at medbay and says he's injured, you should try to help them, but not without doing some extremely unnecessary paperwork, you know, to keep the [Captain](Captain) happy. You might as well do check-ups in the halls on the way to lunch, too. 5) Check on [the](Assistant) [prisoners](Clown) in the brig and the [security officers](Security Officer) themselves.

Derp.","title":"Don't worry, ribs grow back!"},{"location":"roles/Medical-Doctor/#whispers-no-they-dont","text":"Well, besides all that, let's get into the art of treatment and diagnosis. So the first thing you need to know is that all characters have 100 health, but health can go negative down to -100. While a character is above 0 health, they are conscious and functioning. Once they go below 0, they are in critical condition, only able to crawl around very slowly and talk quietly. While in critical condition they also begin to suffocate, taking -1 health from oxygen loss per second. At -25 health, they cannot move or speak any more. at -100 they are dead. So how do you heal hurt people? Well, Medics have access to first aid kits and burn treatment kits, which come with everything you need to treat 95% of injuries encountered (at the moment. Surgery 1.0 will change this when it comes out). The first must-have-at-all-times is the health scanner. It's a tool that when used on a patient, tells you all accumulated damage broken down by type and by body part, allowing you to assess how to proceed with treatment. 'Brute' damage is the most commonly seen type. It is from physical trauma, such as bullets to the chest and toolboxes to the head, as well as damage from low or high pressure environments, such as the vacuum of space. Brute damage is treated with bruise packs. These are found in first aid kits, the medical vending machine, as well as medical life-saver belts. You will typically run through quite a few of these, so refills will probably be necessary from time to time. Bruise packs heal 40 brute damage per use, but only will heal damage on the body part treated, so you will typically waste a lot of the healing potential of each pack as wounds tend to be scattered across the body rather than localized in one spot. The second main source of damage is 'Burn' damage. This is mostly caused from fires and energy weapons, such as energy carbines and light sabres. It shows up, but not as frequently as brute damage. Burn damage is treated with ointment. Typically, you will find that first aid kits are over-provisioned with burn ointment, and you should replace a stack with bruise packs. Burn treatment kits are also a thing, but they are mega overkill for most situations except mass-casualty incidents like station-wide plasma fires. Each ointment use heals 40 burn damage. The third most common damage type is 'oxygen loss (called OxyLoss'), which is more of a symptom of other damage than it is its own damage type. Oxygen damage is accumulated when a character is deprived of oxygen (from space or through station [atmosphere tampering](Atmospherics Technician)) or when they are in critical condition (0 health or less). It behaves exactly like any other damage, but accumulates at a rate of 1 per second. While a person is above 0 health, you can treat OxyLoss just by making sure they apply their internals or bringing them to an oxygenated environment (a place with at least 20% oxygen). Once a patient is in critical condition, however, they lose the ability to breath on their own, so you must apply CPR. CPR is done by clicking on the patient with an empty hand on help intent while they are adjacent to you. CPR takes 5 seconds to be performed, and while you are doing it, the patient stops taking OxyLoss. Once you have completed a round of CPR, the patient's oxygen damage is healed by 2. This means that in order to bring someone out of critical, you may have to perform CPR a lot to get the job done. Another important note is that CPR will not treat the victim's other injuries, so if a patient is at -30 damage from brute and burn sources alone, no amount of CPR will stabilize them until their wounds are treated. This is where help from other medical personnel or even passers-by can be indespensible. Having someone else performing CPR while you diagnose and treat will greatly increase the odds of survival for the patient, especially if there are multiple patients in critical condition. The last damage type currently in game is toxin damage which is only accumulated from radiation poisoning. (This shit is brand new and doesn't quite work how it used to, so idk how to treat it. The charcoal pills don't seem to have an effect, so good luck. If they die, just clone them.)","title":"Whispers no they don't"},{"location":"roles/Medical-Doctor/#imitation-meat","text":"So let's say you've applied what you know as a professional medical practitioner and your patient still died. Or maybe someone just found a cold stiffy shoved in a locker in maintenance. What do you do then? Well, you clone them, of course. Cloning is the ultimate mulligan. It can be done over and over as long as you've got a body to clone. When a character dies, take them to the cloning room and put them in the DNA scanner. This can be done by click-and-dragging their body into the DNA scanner while they are adjacent to it. once they are in and the scanner is shut, go to the cloning console and hit the scan button to create a DNA record. Once you've got their record, navigate to it and hit clone. If the player has not left the server, then it will start cloning their body. Cloning is really fast, only taking 10~15 seconds. Once they are cloned, make sure to pull their old body out of the scanner so they can re-equip their old gear. When it comes to the intersection between cloning and role-playing; it is generally assumed that a clone does not know how exactly they died or, if they were murdered, who did it. Their memory will be foggy and unclear, and they may have some confusion when it comes to understanding that they are a clone. Treat them with a polite sensitivity and ask them how they feel. Note that the one critical flaw of the cloning process is that it requires a corpse in the first place; one that has not been too chewed up, as well. If the body is lost in space, gibbed by explosions, butchered by the [chef](Cook), or taken extensive enough fire damage as to be turned into a husk, then they cannot be cloned. One preventative measure that can be taken against this outcome is to scan high-risk people (or really any takers) in the DNA scanner in advance. It's also a good idea at round start to take turns with the rest of the medical staff scanning each other just in case something happens. You might think you are perfectly safe being stationed in the department that has the cloner, but you'd be surprised what could happen.","title":"Imitation Meat"},{"location":"roles/Medical-Doctor/#medical-modus-operandi","text":"Not sure what to do? Here's a handy set of operations that you can follow: 1) Heal critically injured crew members that are around medbay. They are the top priority. Dead people waiting to be cloned can wait a little longer.

NEVER go find bodies on your own, as you might accidentally end up reviving a filthy [antagonist](antagonist) that puts you into a box and throws you out an airlock. It also might not be a bad idea to ask [Security](Security) if any dead to-be-clones that you get have any outstanding criminal charges. 3) Do in-the-field medical attention. Sometimes you need to go to the action to save your plasma burned crew mates, it's recommended to bring additional medical supplies so you can dole them out to other responders if the situation's bad enough. 4) Heal random dudes.

Access: Mining department , Cargo department , Maintenance. Difficulty: Hard - Very Hard Overview \u00b6 Shaft Miner is one of the most dangerous roles that is not a Command role. Not because you have a lot of responsibilities (you don't, you only have two: mine [asteroids](Asteroid) and [come back alive](So close to impossible that it might as well not even exist)). It's hard because you will often run into hordes of [Xenomorphs](Xenomorph) that will kill you fast if you're not good at the [combat](combat) system. This is Mining, someone stole our shuttle. Anyone know who it was? \u00b6 As a Shaft Miner, the station crew expects you to head out into space, mine ores from asteroids (eventually also from lavaland if it gets added), and get [Cargo](Cargo Technician) some money. You're also expected to be at least somewhat [robust](Combat), since you'll run into a lot of Aliens out there. To assist in your efforts, you get given a multitude of tools: A Mining Hardsuit, to protect you from the cold, airless vacuum of space as well as to give you very slight protection against damage; a mining satchel, to store ores in; a lantern, since space is dark; and a pickaxe and shovel, to mine ores and dig sand out of the asteroid ground. Since you're part of the Cargo department, you're under the supervision of the [Quartermaster](Quartermaster), so ask them for help if you're ever confused on what to do. Also, if Cargo is flushed with [Cargo Technicians](Cargo Technician) who know what they are doing, the Quartermaster has their own set of mining gear in their office, and may join you on your adventures in deep space. In the lockers in the mining locker room, there are a limited number of [Proto Kinetic Accelerators](PKA), otherwise known as the Shaft Miner's best friend. It is a short range, high-damage, unlimited-use gun that can be used for propulsion in deep space, breaking asteroid rocks, and killing things. In addition to the Common channel, the Shaft Miner's [headset](headset) comes with access to the Supplies channel to communicate with the rest of [Cargo](Cargo Technician), and the Science channel to organize what minerals and ores are needed to conduct R&D (when implemented). When mining with the pick axe, keep in mind you can mine multiple chunks of rock at the same time as long as they are adjacent to you.
